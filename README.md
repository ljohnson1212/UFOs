# UFOs

# Objective

	Danaâ€™s webpage and table are working great but she would like some assistance in creating filters so that people that can have a more in depth search on the site. In addition to the date, she wants to  add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Results

	After filtering all of the data the html created UFO website:

# Conclusion and Recommendations

	We were able to create and add the filters to the UFO Sightings website. 

	My recommendations to create a more detailed filter for the date. Currently the site visitor would have to know the specific date of the UFO sighting. Creating that filter would give a novice UFO vistor to be able to search without prior UFO knowledge.
